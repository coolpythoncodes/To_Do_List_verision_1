## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/coolpythoncodes/To_Do_List_verision_1/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/coolpythoncodes/To_Do_List_verision_1/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

* Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
* Problems show where this project is lacking
* With a question you show where contributors can improve the user experience

Thank you for creating them.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in [README.md](README.md)

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in [README.md](README.md) because users don't always look in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.


### Is it of good quality

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It reads well
* For english language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

* To provide a [README.md](README.md) and assorted documents anyone can copy and paste, into their project
* The content is usable by someone who hasn't written something like this before
* Foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open source community.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), I will remove things that do not respect it.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
